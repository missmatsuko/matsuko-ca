## 1. Read 50 books
[Inspired by Bill Gates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTFy8RnUkoU), I'm aiming to read 50 books this year to expand my mind and knowledge. I'll try to list them here as I go.

## 2. Exercise 50 times
This might sound really easy, but I'm notoriously terrible at exercising. Growing up, I hated gym and I never participated in sports. I still haven't found anything physically active that I really enjoy doing. Hopefully I'll find something tolerable by the end of 2020, but at the very least I'll try to exercise 50 times this year.

## 3. Visit a country I haven't been to before
So far I've only been to Canada, the US, and Japan. I'd like to add another country to this list by the end of 2020!

## 4. Make new friends
Especially in real life (IRL) friends who are not [cishet](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cishet) men.

## 5. Sing more/better
I enjoy singing, but I'd like to improve. I'm thinking about joining the [Sing City rock choir in Vancouver](http://singcity.ca/), but first I need to figure out if I'm sticking around Vancouver.

## 6. Learn more American Sign Language (ASL)
I'd like to continue learning ASL through courses and practice. I'm not sure if I'll get a chance to take a formal course this year, but I'd like to at least work through [ASLU's lessons](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/lessons/lessons.htm). I've finished up ASL 1 already, so I'll continue from ASL 2.
