### [DevHub](https://www.devhub.ca/), Toronto and Vancouver
DevHub is a coworking space partnered with [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/), a coding bootcamp.

I love that they have computer monitors to borrow on a first-come, first-serve basis. I worked out of the Toronto location for a week and they never ran out of monitors. I wish more coworking spaces did this - it's so handy!

### [Code & Café](https://www.codecafe.cafe/), Montreal
Pay as you go and unlimited coffee and pastries while you're there! Even posh oat milk lattés!

The decor is adorably geeky. Even [the pricelist](https://www.codecafe.cafe/tarifs/) is presented as an if-else statement!

They have an area where kids can learn to code, so there's lots of cool toys to see, although it can get a bit noisy.

### [Temps Libre / Free Time](https://tempslibre.coop/), Montreal
Part paid coworking space, part free public space. I worked out of the free public space for a few days. The wi-fi is great, and there's a small shop to buy coffee and snacks. There's limited outlets, and the noise level can vary. There's also a kid's play area.
