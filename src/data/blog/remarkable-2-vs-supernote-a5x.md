### Pen

I opted for the [reMarkable 2's Marker Plus](https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2/markers), which has a digital eraser on the end for quick erasing. The Marker (not Marker Plus) is more comparable with the [Supernote's Standard Pen](https://www.supernote.com/#/part?id=SP-03) since neither of them have erasers.

The eraser end of the Marker Plus is convenient, but not necessary since it's still possible to erase by switching to the eraser tool through the user interface (UI). If this is an important feature to you, you could try the [LAMY AL-star EMR pen](https://www.supernote.com/#/part?id=SP-05) which has a side-button that activates the eraser tool.

Both pens are battery-less and don't require charging.

The Marker Plus attaches to the reMarkable 2 magnetically. I find this kind of gimmicky, but it is a bit quicker to access over the Supernote's Standard Pen, whose cap hooks onto the case's fabric pen loop. I'm not very confident in either attachment method - it feels like the pens could fall off by accident.

Supernote's Standard Pen feels heavier than the Marker Plus, and has been harder on my hands. It looks more like a regular pen, and has a removable cap. I dislike both of these design choices since I feel like I'll lose the cap and mix it up with a regular pen.

A unique feature of Supernote's Standard Pen is that it is nib-less and, according to Supernote, "never wears out". I was excited by the idea of never needing to buy replacement nibs until I found out that it's recommended to replace the ceramic core after "6 months of constant use".

I experimented with using the reMarkable's Marker Plus to write on the Supernote A5X, and found that the writing experience felt a lot more paper-like. I think the ceramic nib moves more smoothly, so it feels more like writing on a digital tablet.

Supernote has a few other pens available, but I think I'll try compatible third-party Electro-Magnetic Resonance (EMR) pens with quality nibs to use with the Supernote A5X for a more satisfying writing experience.
