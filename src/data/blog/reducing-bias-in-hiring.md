The last time I was actively looking for employment was very discouraging for me. I'd like to share some ideas for, in my opinion, a better hiring process that reduces bias.

## Obfuscate as much as possible

Typical job applications require cover letters, resumes, and additional information that include a lot of data for biases to manifest.

Information like: employment gaps, employment duration, language, perceived education quality, and even appearance.

<!--
- esp affects caretakers, women, immigrants, lower class, etc.
-->

Even basic information like the name of an applicant can affect hiring results: [a 2009 study in Canada determined that job applicants with "English-sounding" names are 40% more likely to receive an interview than those with "foreign-sounding" names](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/job-applicants-with-foreign-names-have-lesser-chance-for-interviews-ubc-study-1.780909).

<!--
Suggest that the first information to be collected include quantitative data, and only for basic requirements. Contact/identifying information should only be revealed when contacting the applicant to arrange an interview.

e.g.
- Post-secondary degree in X or related field (Y/N)
- Number of FTE years employed in X or related role: (#)
-->

## Select a random group for interviews
<!--
researchers ask whether, after an initial assessment of academic and other performance measures, traditional interviews should be replaced by a lottery among the viable applicants.

## Base hiring on relevant skills
<!--
An interview isn't an accurate representation of an applicant's skills, unless the role involves being interviewed.

Unstructured interviews are the worst. If you're going to interview, have a structured interview. Send the applicant the questions ahead of time.

- diversity in general
- introverts
