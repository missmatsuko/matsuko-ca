## The introduction

About a month ago, the COVID pandemic started to really affect life here in Vancouver. Within the span of a few days we went from business as usual to shutting down most of the city's public spaces.

This was a challenge for the ASL (American Sign Language) practice [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) I help organize, [ASL Social and Practice](https://www.meetup.com/ASL-Social/). Up until this point, we had been meeting in-person at a public library. For the health and safety of our participants, and since more and more potential venues were shutting down anyway, we decided to look at whether it'd be possible to move our Meetup online.

<!-- Keep?
Three of us tested out the following video chat apps:
- [Discord](https://discordapp.com/)
- [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/)
- [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/)
- [Houseparty](https://www.houseparty.com/)
- [Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/)
- [Skype](https://www.skype.com/)
- [Zoom](https://zoom.us/)

We ended up settling on Jitsi Meet for now, although Google Meet is quickly becoming a good contender with the features they've recently been rolling out.

Communicating in ASL through video chat is not optimal, since it's a 3D language presented in a 2D format. There are some aspects of the language that cannot be fully preserved through video. On top of this, we found additional challenges to signed communication caused by design choices that did not fully consider non-auditory communication such as sign language and lip-reading.

## The list

### Text chat interface obstructs videos
- Get screenshot from Jitsi
- May use text chat to share links/media/text, or to clarify something (especially for ASL practice)
- Deaf/HOH may use text chat to communicate to hearing person
- Text chat obstructs some users' videos, can't see if they are seeing/understanding. Would work ok if speaking/hearing.

### Limited number of videos shown in one screen
- Get screenshot from Google Meet (need 4 or 5+ particpants? If still maxes out)
- Cannot see everyone at once, some people may be trying to commicate by sign but they are not on screen
- If person is speaking to communicate, it doesn't really matter if they're visible, can still hear them

### Videos are too small
- Get screenshot from Google Meet (need 4 or 5+ participants? If still maxes out)
- Video too small to see signing
- Again, for speaking communication it doesn't really matter the size of the video since that doesn't affect audio

### Captioning availability and quality
- Get screenshot from Jitsi...?
- Some apps don't have captioning at all (Houseparty?)
- Beneficial for literate(?) Deaf/HOH observer w/ speaking presenter, and no interpreter
- Actually, can any apps show interpreter as picture-picture? **
- Some apps don't attribute captions to specific people (Google Meet is ok, try a diff one)? In this case, might not be able to tell who is speaking.
- Accuracy can vary, especially with auto-captions

### Video cropping
- Get screenshot from Houseparty...?
- If video displayed is cropped differently from what the presenter sees, they can't tell their true signing space.
- Doesn't really affect lip-reading because the face is probably still in view

### Video quality
- Get screenshot from Discord...?
- Video quality (choppiness, freezing, blurriness). Probably blurriness is the worst case since you can't distinguish any partial signs, maybe just some movement/direction.
- Again, for speaking communication it doesn't really matter the video since that doesn't affect audio

### Getting someone's attention
- Get screenshot...? Of what?
- Usually would wave at someone
- Maybe can use text chat, or some way to ping specific people (like reactions but only between 2 people)

### Referring to someone else
- Get screenshot...? Of what?
- Would usually point at someone, but cannot; need to sign or fingerspell name
- Maybe if order of every video is same, and you're placed in there, can point to people around your video
- Maybe can use text chat

### Featuring videos based on audio
- Get screenshot from Google Meet?
- Featured video based on sounds/who is speaking
- Communicating in sign language, perhaps focus on who is moving the most
- People may make sounds without speaking, e.g. laughter, hitting table, misc. sounds

### Screensharing disables presenter's video

- Screenshot from Skype, presenter's perspective (if they go to Skype rather than the shared screen)
- Audience will see only the shared screen, no video from presenter or others in audience
- Presenter cannot sign; may not be able to speak, probably awkward to type in text chat, especially while sharing a different app and only 1 monitor/screen
- Audience cannot lip-read or watch signing
- Captions may be available
