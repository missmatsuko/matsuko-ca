## The situation
I'm a hearing American Sign Language (ASL) learner. I've been helping coordinate the only [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) group in Vancouver for ASL practice, [ASL Social and Practice](https://www.meetup.com/ASL-Social/). Lately we were meeting every other week at the Vancouver Public Library, which has meeting rooms available for free for up to 2 hours. Due to COVID-19, the library closed down and many of the alternative locations we've previously met were starting to shutter as well (e.g. malls, cafes). We typically expect a turnout of 3-10 people, which was under the recommended group size at the time. ASL allows for communication from longer distances than speaking. As more and more places shut down, we were more and more limited for venues. Besides, it was more responsible to avoid in-person contact. So we decided to go online.

There's a lot of group video chats out there. I didn't expect it to be that tricky to find a suitable one for ASL practice. It definitely made me realize that there's a lot of UX choices made based on the hearing world.

We tested out a bunch of video chat apps to find the most suitable ones for our use-case. To be clear, these are not necessarily the best video chat apps for group ASL conversations in general, and certainly not the best video chat apps for a mix of hearing and Deaf conversations.

## The search

### Initial criteria
- Prefer browser apps, especially those that don't require sign-in
- Easy to get started
- Can display up to 12 people
- Participants displayed in a tile/grid view, all at more or less the same size
- Ideally, easy to break into smaller video chats if the conversation naturally breaks apart (same as IRL)
- Video needs to be clear, barring user's hardware and connectivity issues. Not necessarily high-def, but enough def. and not laggy or blurry. and not too small.
- A way to get someone's attention

### What we tried
- [Discord](https://discordapp.com/)
- [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/)
- [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/)
- [Houseparty](https://www.houseparty.com/)
- [Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/)
- [Skype](https://www.skype.com/)
- [Zoom](https://zoom.us/)

If you have any other recommendations, please let me know at info@matsuko.ca

### Discoveries
- Kind of surprised by some things that were very hearing-centric
- Focusing on sound
- Hiding videos after some # of participants
- Lot of web apps were buggier and/or missing key features in desktop apps
- Cropping video based on orientation
- Captions

## The finalists

### Jitsi Meet
Open-source and marketed as secure.

#### Pros
- No account required
- No downloads required
- All participants videos shown on screen (up to how many??)

#### Cons
- Hits the processor pretty hard

### Google Meet
- Unlike Google Hangout, web version shows tile view. Can host ?# people.
- Ideal for smaller groups

#### Pros
- No account required for participants
- No downloads required
- Up for 5 participants shown on screen

#### Cons
- After 5 participants, tile view will still only show 4 videos + your own video. Other layouts show 1 main participant huge and the rest as small videos.
- Host required a GSuite account

### Skype
- Not much different from Zoom. Actually Zoom is better in that it doesn't require participants to have accounts (?), but we were kind of wary about it after a bunch of recent security and creepy issues...

#### Pros
- All participants videos shown on screen (up to how many??)
- Easy to break into smaller chats

#### Cons
- Account required
- Download required (tile view doesn't work on web app)
