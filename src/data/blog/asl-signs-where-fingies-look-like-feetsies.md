I'm learning American Sign Language (ASL), and I'm making a list of signs where the index and middle fingers represent legs. I find these signs are especially intuitive, and pretty cute, too. Let me know if you have any additions (or corrections) for this list.

## Anxious/Restless/Squirmy
Source: ["anxious" at LifePrint](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/a/anxious.htm)

> The sign "SIT" can be modified to show someone squirming in their chair.  This can be used to mean "anxiety" and similar concepts. This sign doesn't exactly mean nervous, it means "restless" or perhaps "ants in the pants."
