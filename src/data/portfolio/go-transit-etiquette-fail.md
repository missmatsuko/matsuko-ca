## Summary
GO Transit is the regional public transit service for the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. Together with DDB, they produced a book of "transit etiquette fails" entitled "Unwritten Rules of Transit Etiquette Written Down" (and in French, "Règles de bienséance non-écrites-maintenant-écrites en transport en commun"). The book is a compilation of "etiquette fails" suggested by GO Transit riders.

This static landing page was created to promote the book, which is available in print and PDF, and in both official languages of Canada (English and French).
