## Summary
This collection includes highlights from my student work from [VanArts’ one-year Interactive Design and Web Development program](https://www.vanarts.com/programs/web-development-interactive-design/) in Vancouver, BC. This intensive program covered aspects of both design and development and included topics such as Adobe Creative Suite, HTML and CSS, JavaScript and jQuery, PHP and MySQL.

The program is composed of 4 back-to-back terms, each culminating with a term project and presentation. In addition to frequent assignments, the first 3 terms of the program also included 2 “Four-Eight” projects each. These projects were like full-day practical exams: a brief would be provided on a Thursday afternoon with technical specifications and client requirements, and a finished website would be submitted the next evening (including research, concept, content, design, development, and deployment).
