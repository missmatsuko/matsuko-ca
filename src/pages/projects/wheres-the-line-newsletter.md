## Summary
Where's the Line? is a power line safety campaign produced by the Joint Utility Safety Team (JUST), a partnership between Albertaâ€™s electric utilities and the Alberta Government.

This landing page was built to promote their power line safety newsletter.

It's a static page built with fundamental web technologies, Twig for templating, and Gulp for building. The page was integrated alongside the existing main WordPress website.
