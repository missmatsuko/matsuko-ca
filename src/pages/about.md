      ## Bio


      Matsuko Friedland is a web developer located in Vancouver, BC. She strives
      for usability and accessibility in all her work.


      Matsuko studied business administration with a focus in finance and
      accounting at [Camosun College](http://camosun.ca/) in Victoria, BC.


      In 2016, Matsuko graduated at the top of her class from [VanArts' Web
      Development and Interactive Design
      program](https://www.vanarts.com/programs/web-development-interactive-design/).


      Currently, Matsuko is working as a front-end developer at [Tribal
      Worldwide/DDB](https://tribalworldwide.ca/). You can also sometimes find

      Aside from web development, she enjoys trying new foods and learning new
      things, especially languages. Matsuko has varying levels of skill in a
      variety of languages, including English, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese,
      French, and American Sign Language (ASL). This gives her an advantageous
      perspective when working on multilingual projects.
